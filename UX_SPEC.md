## 1. Purpose

Defines interaction vocabulary, visual encoding rules, layout zones, and interface behavior contracts for the Tonnetz Interactive Harmonic Explorer.
Serves as the authoritative cross-module UX reference.

---

## 2. Interaction Vocabulary

### Gesture Classification

All pointer/touch interactions are classified by movement:

* **Tap/click** — pointer down + pointer up with movement below drag threshold (~5px or platform default). Eligible for triangle selection and edge-proximity selection.
* **Drag** — pointer down + movement exceeds drag threshold. Always enters scrub or pan mode (drag starting on a triangle = scrub, drag starting on background = pan). Edge-proximity selection is suppressed during drag.
* **Press-hold** — pointer down, chord plays immediately and sounds for the duration of the hold. There is no distinct sustain mode; "sustain" is simply the natural result of holding the pointer down. (UX-D4)

### Camera navigation

* Drag background → pan
* Scroll / pinch → zoom
* Reset control → reset view

### Harmonic interaction

* Hover triangle → highlight (desktop)
* Tap/click triangle → play triad
* Hold triangle → chord sounds for duration of hold (release stops)
* Drag across triangles → scrub playback (trigger on triangle change; crossing an edge between two triangles plays two sequential triads, not a union chord) (UX-D3)
* Tap/click near shared edge → play union chord (see Hit-Testing Model below) (UX-D1)
* Node selection → single pitch preview (future)

### Hit-Testing Model (UX-D1)

Interaction hit-testing uses a **proximity circle** centered on the pointer position. The circle radius is approximately half the triangle edge length.

* If the circle is **entirely enclosed** by a single triangle → that triangle's triad is selected
* If the circle **crosses a shared edge** between two triangles → union chord of both triangles (4 pitch classes) is selected
* If the circle is **centered near a node** and overlaps three or more triangles → behavior is undefined for MVP (treat as nearest-triangle selection)
* **Boundary edges** (only one adjacent triangle) never produce union chords — the circle must cross a shared interior edge

### Progression interaction

* Paste progression → render path
* Play/Stop/Loop progression
* Step forward/back through chords
* Clear button → dismiss progression and return to Idle Exploration (UX-D5)

---

## 3. Visual Encoding Rules

* Main triad → bright fill
* Extension triangles → pale fill
* Non-triangulated tones → dot markers
* Dot-only chords (e.g., diminished and augmented triads) → cluster of dot markers near focus
* Selected chord → highlighted cluster
* Root tone → distinct outline on root vertex
* Progression path → centroid-connected overlay
* Union chord (edge selection) → both adjacent triangles highlighted

---

## 4. Layout Zones

The interface is organized into three primary zones:

| Zone           | Function                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Central Canvas | Tonnetz lattice, interaction surface        |
| Control Panel  | progression input, playback controls, tempo |
| Toolbar        | view reset, optional overlays, mode toggles |

Layout must remain responsive:

* control panel collapsible on small screens
* canvas remains primary focus element

---

## 5. UI State Model

Primary interface states:

| State              | Description                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Idle Exploration   | user freely explores lattice           |
| Chord Selected     | chord cluster highlighted and playable |
| Progression Loaded | progression path displayed             |
| Playback Running   | scheduled playback active              |

State transitions:

* Idle → Chord Selected (triangle or edge-proximity interaction)
* Idle → Progression Loaded (paste/import)
* Chord Selected → Progression Loaded (paste/import dismisses current selection)
* Progression Loaded → Playback Running (play)
* Playback Running → Progression Loaded (stop)
* Playback Running → Playback Running (tap/click is ignored during active playback; user must stop first) (UX-D6)
* Progression Loaded → Idle Exploration (clear button) (UX-D5)
* Chord Selected → Idle Exploration (tap empty space or timeout)

Audio and renderer must react deterministically to these states.

---

## 6. Interaction Timing Rules

* Interactive playback: immediate (chord sounds on pointer-down, stops on pointer-up)
* Scheduled playback: shared transport timebase (see ARCH_AUDIO_ENGINE.md §5)
* Pointer movement sampled per animation frame
* Retrigger only on triangle change
* Drag threshold: ~5px pointer movement or platform default; below threshold = tap, above = drag

---

## 7. Progression Focus Policy

When a progression is loaded and rendered as a path, chord placement uses **chain focus**:

* The first chord is placed relative to the current viewport center (initial focus).
* Each subsequent chord uses the preceding chord shape's centroid as its placement focus.
* If the progression path drifts beyond the visible viewport, the user corrects via pan/zoom.

See HC-D11 in ARCH_HARMONY_CORE.md.

## 9. Accessibility Baselines

* touch-sized interaction targets (proximity circle provides generous hit area)
* keyboard navigation (future)
* sufficient visual contrast for triad vs extension encoding
* dot-cluster markers distinguishable from triangle fills

---

## 10. Future UX Extensions

* roman numeral overlay
* tonal center highlighting
* harmonic heatmaps
* guided harmonic navigation
* node-proximity interaction (three-triangle overlap at node — currently undefined)
* theming architecture — customizable color palette for triangle fills, dots, path, highlights, grid (target: module assembly phase)

## 11. UX Decision Log

```
UX-D1: Proximity-circle hit-testing model
Date: 2026-02-13
Status: Closed
Priority: Critical
Decision:
Hit-testing uses a proximity circle (~half triangle edge length) centered on the pointer.
Circle enclosed by one triangle → triad. Circle crosses shared edge → union chord.
Boundary edges excluded. Node overlap (3+ triangles) undefined for MVP.
Rationale:
Provides generous touch targets. Unifies triangle and edge selection into a single
spatial model. Avoids separate edge hit targets with small tap areas.
Revisit if: Mobile testing reveals the proximity radius needs tuning, or node overlap
becomes musically useful.
```

```
UX-D2: Adjacent triangle selection is edge selection
Date: 2026-02-13
Status: Closed
Priority: Important
Decision:
"Adjacent triangle selection" in SPEC.md is a synonym for edge selection, not a
distinct interaction. Remove as separate functional requirement.
Rationale:
Edge selection (union chord of two adjacent triangles) already covers the same
behavior. A separate "adjacent triangle" interaction would duplicate it with a
different gesture for no added value.
Revisit if: Multi-select interaction (building extensions interactively) is added
in a future phase.
```

```
UX-D3: Drag-scrub does not trigger union chords
Date: 2026-02-13
Status: Closed
Priority: Important
Decision:
Dragging across triangles plays sequential triads. Crossing an edge during drag
produces two sequential triad triggers, not a union chord. Union chords are
tap/click-only via the proximity-circle model.
Rationale:
Union chords during drag would be musically disruptive — every triangle-to-triangle
scrub would produce a 4-note chord at each boundary. Sequential triads match the
expected scrub behavior.
Revisit if: Users request a modifier key/gesture to enable union chords during drag.
```

```
UX-D4: No distinct sustain mode
Date: 2026-02-13
Status: Closed
Priority: Important
Decision:
Press-hold is not a separate sustain mode. The chord sounds on pointer-down and
stops on pointer-up. If the user begins dragging after holding, scrub mode begins
once the drag threshold is exceeded.
Rationale:
Simplest model. "Sustain" is the natural result of holding the pointer down.
No mode transition ambiguity between hold and drag.
Revisit if: Musicians request a latch/sustain toggle for hands-free exploration.
```

```
UX-D5: Progression dismissal via clear button
Date: 2026-02-13
Status: Closed
Priority: Important
Decision:
A visible Clear button in the control panel dismisses the loaded progression and
returns the UI to Idle Exploration state.
Rationale:
Explicit, always discoverable, works on both desktop and mobile.
Keyboard shortcut (Escape) may be added later as a convenience.
Revisit if: User testing shows a need for additional dismissal gestures.
```

```
UX-D6: Interaction suppressed during active playback
Date: 2026-02-13
Status: Closed
Priority: Important
Decision:
Tap/click interactions on the lattice are suppressed while scheduled playback is
running. The user must stop playback before selecting new chords or edges.
Drag interactions (pan/zoom) remain available during playback.
Rationale:
Prevents conflicting audio triggers (interactive vs scheduled). Keeps the
playback state machine simple. Pan/zoom is harmless during playback and useful
for following a long progression path.
Revisit if: Users request the ability to interrupt playback by tapping a chord.
```
