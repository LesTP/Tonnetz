## Multi-chord patterns and harmonic gestures that define styles and create specific effects.

"Satin Doll" (Duke Ellington, 1953)
Tags: ii-V-I (The Jazz Cadence)

**Analysis:** ii-V-I (in C: Dm7–G7–Cmaj7)

**Chords (in C):** Dm7 / G7 / Cmaj7

**Comment:** The most common chord progression in jazz, a cadential succession whose roots descend in fifths from the supertonic to the dominant to the tonic. The iim7–V7–Imaj7 voicing provides smooth voice leading: the third of one chord becomes the seventh of the next, and the seventh falls a half-step to become the third. It has been used for a hundred years and is "a staple of virtually every type of popular music," including jazz, R&B, pop, rock, and country.

**Other songs:**
- "Honeysuckle Rose" (1928)
- "If I Fell" (The Beatles)
- "I'd Really Love To See You Tonight" (England Dan & John Ford Coley, 1976) — verse: Dm7 / G7 / C
- "It Never Rains In Southern California" (Albert Hammond, 1972) — verse/chorus: Dm7 / G7 / C
- Bach — Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I, Prelude I, opening: I–ii–V–I

"Twist And Shout" (The Beatles, 1964)
Tags: I-IV-V (The Rock/Blues Foundation)

**Analysis:** I-IV-V (in C: C–F–G)

**Chords (in C):** C / F / G

**Comment:** The infamous three-chord Rock and Roll Progression is a staple of rock 'n' roll. The Rock Progression omitted the softer-sounding vi chord from the doo-wop changes to create a harder rock sound. Common variations include I-IV-V-I and I-IV-V-IV.

**Other songs:**
- "Do You Love Me" (Contours, 1962) — verse: C / F / G
- "Mr. Jones" (Counting Crows, 1993) — chorus: C / F / G
- "Love Me Do" (The Beatles, 1964)
- "Sunshine On My Shoulders" (John Denver, 1974)
- "Glory Days" (Bruce Springsteen, 1985)
- "My Life" (Billy Joel, 1979)

"Let It Be" (The Beatles)
Tags: I-V-vi-IV (The "Axis of Awesome" / Modern Pop Progression)

**Analysis:** I-V-vi-IV (in C: C–G–Am–F)

**Chords (in C):** C / G / Am / F

**Comment:** A common chord progression popular across several genres. The vi-IV-I-V rotation was dubbed the sensitive female chord progression after Boston Globe columnist Marc Hirsh noticed it in Joan Osborne's "One of Us." Both rotations are a variant of the doo-wop I-vi-IV-V progression.

**Other songs:**
- "Forever Young" (Alphaville)
- "Beast of Burden" (The Rolling Stones)
- "Someone Like You" (Adele) — chorus
- "Africa" (Toto)
- "When I Come Around" (Green Day)
- vi-IV-I-V rotation: "Poker Face" (Lady Gaga), "Zombie" (The Cranberries), "Stronger" (Kelly Clarkson)

"Stay" (Maurice Williams, 1960)
Tags: I-vi-IV-V (The Doo-Wop Progression / "50s Progression")

**Analysis:** I-vi-IV-V (in C: C–Am–F–G7)

**Chords (in C):** C / Am / F / G7

**Comment:** The 50s progression is a chord progression and turnaround common in the 1950s and early '60s, particularly associated with doo-wop. The vi chord before IV prolongs the tonic by substitution and creates a bass line descending in thirds: I down to vi down to IV. The doo-wop progression has been a rock staple since the late 1950s.

**Other songs:**
- "Earth Angel" (The Penguins, 1954)
- "Duke of Earl" (Gene Chandler, 1962)
- "Wonderful World" (Sam Cooke, 1960) — verse: C / Am / F / G7
- "Eternal Flame" (The Bangles, 1989)
- "Happiness Is a Warm Gun" (The Beatles) — chorus
- "Those Magic Changes" (from Grease) — self-parody: "C-C-C-C / A-A-A-A-minor / F-F-F-F / G-G-G-G-seven"

"Johnny B. Goode" (Chuck Berry)
Tags: 12-Bar Blues (I7-I7-I7-I7 / IV7-IV7-I7-I7 / V7-IV7-I7-V7)

**Analysis:** I-IV-V with dominant 7ths in a 12-bar form

**Standard form (in C):**
```
C7  C7  C7  C7
F7  F7  C7  C7
G7  F7  C7  G7
```

**Quick-change variation:**
```
I   IV  I   I
IV  IV  I   I
V   IV  I   I
```

**Comment:** One of the most popular chord progressions in popular music, based on the I-IV-V chords of a key. The dominant seventh chords on each degree fall in a grey area between the strong major chord and the somber minor chord. Mastery of the blues and rhythm changes are critical elements for building a jazz repertoire.

**Other songs:**
- "Sweet Home Chicago" (Robert Johnson, 1936)
- "Hound Dog" (Elvis Presley)
- "What'd I Say" (Ray Charles, 1959)
- "Folsom Prison Blues" (Johnny Cash)
- "Ball and Biscuit" (White Stripes)
- "Empty Bed Blues" (Bessie Smith)

"All The Things You Are" (Jerome Kern, 1939)
Tags: Descending Fifths Chain (I-IV-vii°-iii-vi-ii-V-I or subsets)

**Analysis:** Full diatonic circle: I-IV-vii°-iii-vi-ii-V-I. Common subsets: vi-ii-V-I, I-IV-V-I.

**Chords (A section, in C):**
```
Am7 / Dm7 / G7 / Cmaj7 /
Fmaj7 / B7 / Emaj7
```

**Comment:** Undoubtedly the most common and the strongest of all harmonic progressions, consisting of adjacent roots in ascending fourth or descending fifth relationship. Diatonic circle progressions use only chords from the diatonic scale. If there is one winning formula at the poppy end of popular music, it is those progressions whose roots follow a predetermined movement descending in intervals of a fifth.

**Other songs:**
- "Autumn Leaves" (1946) — A section in C/Am: Dm7 / G7 / Cmaj7 / Fmaj7 / Bm7b5 / E7 / Am7
- "The Shadow of Your Smile" (1965) — Bm7 / E7 / Am7 / Dm7 / G7 / Cmaj7
- "Fly Me To The Moon" (1954)
- "I Will Survive" (1979)
- vi-ii-V-I in Mozart's Sonata, K. 545
- vi-ii-V-I in Bach's WTC I, Prelude in F♯ Major

"Sweet Georgia Brown" (Bernie and Pinkard, 1925)
Tags: Circle of Fifths with Dominants (VI7-II7-V7-I or variations)

**Analysis:** (III7)-VI7-II7-V7-I. In C: (E7)-A7-D7-G7-C.

**Chords (in C):** E7 / A7 / D7 / G7 / C

**Comment:** The ragtime progression is a chain of secondary dominants — each dominant chord acquired its own dominant, which in turn acquired yet another dominant. The third and seventh of each chord descend by half-step to become the seventh and third of the next, creating two chromatic lines. It may be perceived as a harder, bouncier sounding progression than the diatonic vi-ii-V7-I.

**Other songs:**
- "Hello! Ma Baby" (Howard & Emerson, 1899) — chorus
- "Charleston" (James P. Johnson, 1923)
- "Doxy" (Sonny Rollins, 1954)
- "Alice's Restaurant" (Arlo Guthrie, 1967)
- "Keep On Truckin' Mama" (traditional)
- Liebesträume (Liszt, 1850) — opening
- Bridge of jazz standards: E7-A7-D7-G7 (V7/vi-V7/ii-V7/V-V7)

"Walk, Don't Run" (The Ventures, 1960)
Tags: Descending Tetrachord (I-VII-VI-V or i-♭VII-♭VI-V)

**Analysis:** i-♭VII-♭VI-V (Andalusian cadence). In Am: Am-G-F-E.

**Chords (in Am):** Am / G / F / E

**Comment:** The Andalusian cadence is a term adopted from flamenco music for a chord progression comprising four chords descending stepwise — a i-♭VII-♭VI-V progression, otherwise known as the minor descending tetrachord. Traceable back to the Renaissance, its effective sonorities made it one of the most popular progressions in classical music. Despite the name it is not a true cadence; it is most often used as an ostinato.

**Other songs:**
- "Runaway" (Del Shannon, 1961)
- "Hit The Road Jack" (Ray Charles, 1961)
- "Good Vibrations" (The Beach Boys, 1966)
- "Sultans Of Swing" (Dire Straits, 1979)
- "California Dreamin'" (The Mamas & the Papas, 1965) — reordered: i-♭VI-♭VII-V
- "Comfortably Numb" (Pink Floyd, 1979) — altered: i-♭VII-♭VI-iv
- Flamenco keys: por arriba (Am-G-F-E), por medio (Dm-C-B♭-A)

"Greensleeves" (traditional)
Tags: Lament Bass (i-♭VII-i-V / Passamezzo antico and Folia)

**Analysis:** Passamezzo antico: i-VII-i-V / III-VII-i-V-i. In Am: Am-G-Am-E / C-G-Am-E-Am. La Folia: i-V-i-VII / III-VII-i-V (16-bar form).

**Chords (La Folia in Am):**
```
Am / E7 / Am / G /
C  / G  / Am / E7 /
Am / E7 / Am / G /
C  / G  / Am E7 / Am Am /
```

**Comment:** The passamezzo antico was a ground bass popular during the Italian Renaissance. The romanesca is a variant where the first chord is III. La Folia is one of the oldest European musical themes — over three centuries, more than 150 composers have used it.

**Other songs:**
- "Greensleeves" — refrain follows the romanesca (III-VII-i-V); verses follow the passamezzo antico
- "Before He Cheats" (Carrie Underwood, 2006) — passamezzo antico variant
- "Starts with Goodbye" (Carrie Underwood) — passamezzo antico variant
- "Stairway to Heaven" (Led Zeppelin) — "essentially a variant of the [passamezzo antico] progression"
- La Folia composers: Lully (1672), Corelli (1700), Scarlatti (1710), Vivaldi (1705), Bach (Peasants' Cantata, 1742), Rachmaninov (Variations on a theme by Corelli, 1931)
- "Lamento della Ninfa" (Monteverdi, 1638) — earliest noted use of descending tetrachord with triad chords

"Ain't Misbehavin'" (Fats Waller, 1929)
Tags: Ascending Chromatic Bass (1-♯1-2-♯2 / I-♯I°-ii-♯II° patterns)

**Analysis:** 1-♯1-2-♯2 chromatic ascending bass line. In C: C-C♯°7-Dm7-D♯°7.

**Chords (A section, in C):** C / C♯°7 / Dm7 / D♯°7 / C/E / E7♯5 / F6 / Fm6

**Comment:** Ascending bass line progressions are a type of moving bass line progression where the bass notes of each chord move higher, typically following "1-2-3-4," "1-♯1-2-♯2," or "1-2-♭3-3" patterns. The I-♯I°7-ii7-V "diminished cliché" forms a "1-♯1-2" ascending chromatic bass line and was used to write numerous 1920s and 1930s ballads. Scott Joplin and other ragtime writers frequently used the "IV-♯IV°-V7" progression to brighten their songs.

**Other songs:**
- "Like A Rolling Stone" (Bob Dylan, 1965) — diatonic 1-2-3-4-5 bass: C / Dm / Em / F / G
- "Stormy Weather" (1933) — A section: Cmaj7 / C♯°7 / Dm7 / G7 (definitive diminished cliché)
- "Lean On Me" (Bill Withers, 1972)
- "Jingle Bell Rock" (Bobby Helms, 1957)
- "Little Saint Nick" (Beach Boys, 1963)
- "Bennie And The Jets" (Elton John, 1974)

"My Funny Valentine" (1937)
Tags: Descending Chromatic Bass (8-7-♭7-6 / Descending line cliché)

**Analysis:** Descending minor cliché: vi-vi(M7)-vi7-vi6. In C/Am: Am-Am(M7)-Am7-Am6. Bass descends chromatically: A-G♯-G-F♯.

**Chords (in Am):** Am / Am(M7) / Am7 / Am6

**Comment:** Descending bass line progressions move the bass notes lower, generally in half or whole steps, typically following "8-7-6-5" and "8-7-♭7-6" bass note patterns. The descending minor cliché (vi-vi(M7)-vi7-vi6) is often used to provide a feeling of movement when a chord is sustained. Adding declining bass lines to minor cliché progressions creates even more interesting textures.

**Other songs:**
- "Stairway To Heaven" (Led Zeppelin, 1972) — Am-Am9/G♯-C/G-D/F♯
- "Time In A Bottle" (1973) — Am-Am(M7)/G♯-Am7/G-Am6/F♯
- "Michelle" (The Beatles, 1966) — bridge
- "Georgia On My Mind" (1930)
- "Piano Man" (Billy Joel, 1974)
- "Whiter Shade of Pale" (1967)
- "Georgia On My Mind" (1930)
- Pachelbel Canon in D — ground bass with descending bass D-C♯-B-A-G-F♯-G-A

"Walk, Don't Run" (The Ventures, 1960) / "Hit The Road Jack" (Ray Charles, 1961)
Tags: Aeolian Descent (i-♭VII-♭VI-V or i-♭VII-♭VI-♭VII)

**Analysis:** i-♭VII-♭VI-V (Andalusian cadence). In Am: Am–G–F–E.

**Chords (in Am):** Am / G / F / E

**Comment:** The Andalusian cadence is the primary expression of the Aeolian descent — the same progression as the Descending Tetrachord (#8), but emphasising the modal rather than bass-line perspective. The bass descends stepwise through a Phrygian tetrachord (A-G-F-E). The i-♭VII-♭VI-♭VII variant avoids dominant function entirely.

**Other songs:** See #8 for full list.

"On Broadway" (The Drifters, 1963)
Tags: Dorian Vamp (i-IV or i-♭VII)

**Analysis:** i-♭VII vamp (classic rock vamp). In Am/C: C / B♭ / C / B♭.

**Chords (in C):** C / B♭ / C / B♭

**Comment:** A double tonic is a chord progression consisting of a regular back-and-forth motion between two chords. It is extremely common in African music, Asian music, and European music. Double tonic patterns may repeat open-endedly, though they are often closed through a tonic close (Am|G|Am-G|Am) or varied through a binary scheme ending on the dominant then tonic (Am|G|Am|E || Am|G|Am-G|Am).

**Other songs:**
- "My Sweet Lord" (George Harrison, 1970) — relative minor vamp: C / Am / C / Am
- "Monday, Monday" (Mamas & Papas, 1966) — suspension vamp: C / Csus4 / C / Csus4
- "Sumer is Icumen in" (medieval) — double tonic beginning on lower note
- "The Woods so Wild" (Elizabethan) — double tonic beginning on lower note
- "Mkwaze mmodzi" (African) — double tonic beginning on upper note
- "(Ghost) Riders In The Sky" (1961), "It Won't Be Long" (Beatles, 1963), "El Condor Pasa" (Simon & Garfunkel, 1970), "I'm On Fire" (Springsteen, 1985) — Am-C displacement vamp

"Gloria" (Shadows Of Knight, 1966)
Tags: Mixolydian Rock (I-♭VII-IV)

**Analysis:** I-♭VII-IV (Classic Rock Progression). In E: E–D–A.

**Chords (in E):** E / D / A

**Comment:** The I-♭VII-IV Classic Rock Progression follows the Circle of Fifths movement and the chords are usually played without embellishment. The main characteristic is the use of borrowed chords from another key, in particular the ♭III, ♭VI, or ♭VII chords to create an overall blues feel. Common variations include ♭VII-IV-I, I-IV-♭VII-IV, I-♭III-IV-I, and I-♭VII.

**Other songs:**
- "More Than A Feeling" (Boston, 1976)
- "You Got It" (Roy Orbison, 1989)
- Variation ♭VII-IV-I: D-A-E
- Variation I-IV-♭VII-IV: E-A-D-A
- Variation I-♭III-IV-I: E-G-A-E
- Variation I-♭VII: E-D

"In My Life" (The Beatles, 1965)
Tags: Modal Interchange (I-iv-I or IV-iv-I)

**Analysis:** IV→iv→I (minor plagal cadence). In A: D–Dm–A.

**Chords (verse, in A):** A / E / F♯m / A7/G / D / Dm / A

**Comment:** Switching the subdominant from major to minor before returning to I — the IV→iv→I motion. This idea dates back most famously to Cole Porter's "Every Time We Say Goodbye," where the lyric *how strange the change from major to minor* narrates the chord itself. The ♭VII7 chord, borrowed from the parallel minor, can also resolve to I, commonly preceded by IV→iv→♭VII7→I.

**Other songs:**
- "Every Time We Say Goodbye" (Cole Porter) — A section in E♭: E♭ / E♭° / A♭m6-B♭7 / E♭7 / A♭7 / A♭m
- "If I Fell" (The Beatles)
- "My Romance" — measures 9 and 11 (backdoor progression)
- "There Will Never Be Another You" — measures 10 and 28
- Minor plagal cadence: iv7→I or ♭VII7→I (the backdoor progression)

"Have You Met Miss Jones?" (Rodgers and Hart, 1937) — bridge
Tags: Chromatic Mediant Shift (I-♭VI, I-♭III, I-III)

**Analysis:** Major thirds cycle: B♭-G♭-D (each key center a major third apart). Bridge progression:

**Chords (bridge):**
```
BbM7 BbM7 / Abm7 Db7 / GbM7 GbM7 / Em7 A7 /
DM7  DM7  / Abm7 Db7 / GbM7 GbM7 / Gm7 C7
```

**Comment:** The harmonic use of the chromatic third relation originated in the Romantic era and may occur on any structural level, for example in chord progressions or through key changes. Precisely because of this equidistancy, the roots of these three chords can produce a destabilizing effect; if C, A-flat, and E appear as the tonic pitches of three key areas on a larger level, the identity of the composition's tonal center can only be determined by the closure of the composition. On the circle of fifths, three key centers a major third apart form an equilateral triangle; there are only four unique thirds cycles.

**Other songs:**
- "Giant Steps" (John Coltrane, 1960) — three key centers B, G, E♭
- "Countdown" (John Coltrane) — reharmonization of "Tune Up" using major thirds cycle
- See also #17 (Coltrane Changes) for the systematic substitution method

"Giant Steps" (John Coltrane, 1960)
Tags: Coltrane Changes (Major thirds cycle)

**Analysis:** Three tonal centers related by major thirds (B–G–E♭). The ii-V-I turnaround is substituted with chords cycling through all three key centers.

**Chords ("Giant Steps"):**
```
BM7  D7   / GM7  Bb7  / EbM7 EbM7 / Am7  D7  /
GM7  Bb7  / EbM7 F#7  / BM7  BM7  /
Fm7  Bb7  / EbM7 EbM7 / Am7  D7   / GM7  GM7  /
C#m7 F#7  / BM7  BM7  / Fm7  Bb7  / EbM7 EbM7 /
C#m7 F#7
```

**Comment:** The Coltrane changes use substitute chords over common jazz progressions, with root movement by major thirds creating an augmented triad of key centers (thus the "giant steps"). Slonimsky's Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns (1947) contains the first half of Giant Steps in its preface. The bridge of "Have You Met Miss Jones?" (1937) may have inspired the innovation.

**Other songs:**
- "Countdown" — reharmonization of Miles Davis's "Tune Up"
- "Lazy Bird" — two tonal centers a major third apart in its A section
- "26-2" — reharmonization of Charlie Parker's "Confirmation"
- "Satellite" — based on "How High the Moon"
- "Body and Soul" — Coltrane's arrangement (bridge)
- "Three Little Words" (from Bags & Trane)

Schubert, Piano Sonata in A minor, Op. 42, first movement, mm. 32–39
Tags: Omnibus Progression (Chromatic voice leading pattern)

**Analysis:** Chromatic lines moving in opposite directions. Bass descends chromatically; upper voice ascends chromatically.

**Chords (simple example in C):** C / G7(6/5) / B♭7 / Dm(6/4) / B♭7(4/2) / G7 / C

**Extended form:**
```
C / G7(6/5) / Bb7 / Dm(6/4) / Bb7(4/2) / G7 /
Bm(6/4) / G7(4/2) / E7 / G#m(6/4) / E7(4/2) /
C#7 / Fm(6/4) / C#7(4/2) / Bb7 / Dm(6/4) /
Bb7(4/2) / G7 / C
```

**Comment:** The omnibus progression features chromatic lines moving in opposite directions — also known as chromatic wedge progressions. Originating in the Baroque harmonizations of the descending chromatic lament bass, in its fullest form the bass traverses a whole chromatic octave. The pattern divides the octave into four equal parts and may be halted at any point, facilitating modulation to any key.

**Other songs:**
- Brahms, Opus 116, No. 3
- Tchaikovsky, Pathétique Symphony, first movement
- Schubert, Piano Sonata in A minor, Op. 42, first movement, mm. 32–39

"Lazy Bird" (John Coltrane, arrangement of Tadd Dameron's "Lady Bird")
Tags: Tritone Substitution Chain

**Analysis:** ♭II7 substitutes for V7. In C: D♭7 replaces G7 (both share the tritone B–F / C♭–F). Applied to I-vi-ii-V turnaround: C–E♭7–D7–D♭7. Applied to ii-V-I: Dm7–D♭7–Cmaj7.

**Comment:** The ♭II7 substitutes for V7 because both share the same tritone (in C: G7 contains B–F, D♭7 contains F–C♭/B). Performing this substitution (Dm7–G7–Cmaj7 becomes Dm7–D♭7–Cmaj7) creates smooth chromatic root descent: D→D♭→C. The tritone was historically known as *diabolus in musica* and was banned by the church for liturgical use for centuries.

**Other songs:**
- I-vi-ii-V with tritone on vi and V: C–E♭7–D7–D♭7
- I-vi-ii-V with tritone on every chord but I: C–E♭7–A♭M7–D♭7
- "Lazy Bird" uses IV-♭VII-I (backdoor) together with tritone substitution
- Bird Blues progression uses tritone substitution of dominant chords leading by half-step

"Cherokee" (measures 7–8 of A section)
Tags: Backdoor Progression (iv-♭VII-I)

**Analysis:** iv7-♭VII7-I (backdoor ii-V). In C: Fm7–B♭7–Cmaj7. Also expressed as IV7-♭VII7-I.

**Chords (in C):** Fm7 / B♭7 / Cmaj7

**Comment:** The backdoor progression (iv7→♭VII7→I) is nicknamed the backdoor ii-V because it arrives at the tonic through an unexpected route — the normal ii-V7-I being the "front door." The ♭VII7, a pivot chord borrowed from the parallel minor, can resolve to I and is considered a bluesy cadence. It is commonly preceded by IV going to iv, then ♭VII7, then I.

**Other songs:**
- "Cherokee" — measures 7–8 of the A section
- "My Romance" — measures 9 and 11
- "There Will Never Be Another You" — measures 10 and 28
- "In My Life" (The Beatles)
- "If I Fell" (The Beatles)
- "Lazy Bird" (Coltrane) — IV-♭VII-I used repeatedly as a chord substitution

"I Got Rhythm" (George Gershwin) — last two bars of A section
Tags: Turnaround (I-VI7-ii-V7)

**Analysis:** I-vi-ii-V (standard turnaround). Chromatic variant: I-VI7-II7-V7 (ragtime turnaround).

**Turnaround types charted (in C):**
```
Folk:              C / G7
Jazz:              C / Dm7 / G7
Standard:          C / Am7 / Dm7 / G7
Ragtime:           C / A7  / D7  / G7
Diminished cliché: C / C#o7 / Dm7 / G7
Circle:            Em7 / Am7 / Dm7 / G7
Circle (dominant): E7  / A7  / D7  / G7
Dameron:           Cmaj7 / EbMaj7 / AbMaj7 / DbMaj7
Henderson:         C7  / A7  / Gb7 / Eb7
```

**Comment:** A turnaround is a passage at the end of a section that leads back to the beginning, typically starting on I and ending on V7 (or ♭II7 as dominant substitute). The stock jazz-blues turnaround is I7-VI7-ii7-V7 — if there is one turnaround that has to become second nature, this is it. The I-vi-ii-V may be transformed through chord substitutions: replacing vi and ii with dominants gives I-VI7-II7-V7 (the Ragtime progression).

**Other songs:**
- "Heart and Soul" (1938) — standard I-vi-ii-V turnaround
- V-IV-I blues turnaround: the most commonly used blues turnaround (e.g. in A: E7-D7-A7-E7)
- Tadd Dameron turnaround: I-♭III-♭VI-♭II7 (Cmaj7-E♭Maj7-A♭Maj7-D♭Maj7)
- Joe Henderson's "Isotope" (1964): I7-VI7-♭V7-♭III7 (C7-A7-G♭7-E♭7)

**Comment:** Rhythm changes refers to the chord progression from Gershwin's "I Got Rhythm," a thirty-two-bar AABA form and one of the most common vehicles for jazz improvisation. The bridge consists of dominant sevenths following the circle of fifths — known as the Sears Roebuck bridge. The A and B sections were often used separately: Parker's "Scrapple from the Apple" uses "Honeysuckle Rose" for the A but Rhythm's III7-VI7-II7-V7 bridge.

"All The Things You Are" (Jerome Kern, 1939)
Tags: Modulating Sequence (Rosalia)

**Analysis:** A sequence that modulates to a new key. The sequential passage begins in the home key and moves either diatonically or chromatically; harmonic function is generally disregarded, or at least far less important than the sequential motion.

**Comment:** A modulating sequence (rosalia) begins in the home key and moves diatonically or chromatically, with harmonic function subordinate to the sequential motion. The sequence may end at a point suggesting a new tonality, and the composition continues naturally in that key. In "All The Things You Are," the A section uses a common-tone chord to modulate to a new key and repeats this three more times.

**Other songs:**
- "All The Things You Are" (1939) — four modulations using common-tone chords
- Circle of fifths traversal: C-G-D-A-E-B-F♯-C♯-G♯-D♯-A♯(B♭)-F-C

"Because" (The Beatles, 1969)
Tags: Neapolitan Sixth Resolution (♭II6-V-i in minor)

**Analysis:** ♭II6→V→i. The Neapolitan is a major chord built on the lowered second (♭II) scale degree, most commonly in first inversion (♭II6 or N6). It functions as a chromatic alteration of the subdominant, preparing the dominant.

**Chords ("Because," in C♯m):** C♯m / C♯m / D♯m7b5 / G♯7 / A / C♯m / A7 / A9 / D / Ddim7

The A major chord (♭VI) and the D major chord (♭II, the Neapolitan) provide the chromatic colour against the C♯ minor tonic.

**Comment:** The Neapolitan chord prepares the dominant, substituting for IV or ii, and is found far more often in minor keys. Named for the Neapolitan School (Scarlatti, Pergolesi, Paisiello, Cimarosa), it was already established by the late 17th century. It is called a "sixth" because in first inversion the interval between the bass note and the root is a minor sixth.

**Voice leading:** The ♭II root moves down by a diminished third to the leading tone (in C: D♭→B♮), the bass rises by step to the dominant root, and the fifth resolves down a semitone.

**Classical examples:**
- Vivaldi, *The Four Seasons*, "Summer" — Neapolitan-sixth descent (A♭ in G minor)
- J.S. Bach, *St Matthew Passion*, No. 19 — on the word "Plagen" (G♭ in F minor)
- Beethoven, *Moonlight Sonata*, Op. 27 No. 2 — opening bars (D♮ in C♯ minor)

**Pop/rock examples:**
- "Because" (The Beatles)
- "Do You Want to Know a Secret" (The Beatles)
- "Mother's Little Helper" (The Rolling Stones)
- "Come and Get It" (Badfinger)
- "Ne me quitte pas" (Jacques Brel)
- "Don't Stop Movin'" (Livin' Joy)

"Lady Madonna" (The Beatles, 1968)
Tags: "Mario Cadence" (♭VI-♭VII-I)

**Analysis:** ♭VI-♭VII-I. In A major: F-G-A. A cadence using two borrowed major chords from the parallel minor (♭VI and ♭VII) rising stepwise into the tonic — named for its prominent use in Super Mario Bros. music (Koji Kondo).

**Chords ("Lady Madonna," in A):** A A D D A A D D A A D E F♯ G♯ A A

The ending figure D–E–F♯–G♯–A walks up chromatically, but the core harmonic gesture is the ♭VII (G major, approached via F♯) resolving up by whole step to I (A). The verse cadence uses the ♭VI-♭VII-I motion (F-G-A) against the A major tonic.

**Comment:** The ♭VI-♭VII-I cadence approaches the tonic from below via two borrowed major chords, producing a bright, triumphant resolution that sidesteps dominant function entirely. Unlike the authentic cadence (V-I) which resolves by descending fifth, and unlike the plagal cadence (IV-I) which resolves by descending fourth, the Mario cadence resolves by ascending whole step — giving it a distinctive sense of arrival through upward momentum. The ♭VII chord acts not as a dominant but as a chromatic passing chord between ♭VI and I.

**Other songs:**
- "King of the World" (Steely Dan)
- "Thanksgiving" (Vince Guaraldi)
- "SOS" (ABBA)
- "All I Wanna Do" (Sheryl Crow)
